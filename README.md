### Hi there 👋, I'm Hugo.

I'm a Software Engineer and Team Leader at [Runtime Revolution](https://www.runtime-revolution.com/) based in Lisbon 🇵🇹.
During work I mostly develop webapps for clients that need high performance and high availability systems to manage their data and or processes, and In my spare time I really enjoy 📷 photography and ☕ coffee (of course) and 🍳 cooking.
